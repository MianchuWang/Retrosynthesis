## Background

MCTS and A* search have significantly contributed to computer-aided retrosynthesis.

* **A\* search** is guaranteed to find the optimal solution, but the efficiency of A* is compromised due to insufficient exploration.
* **MCTS** has exploration, but compulsive exploration decreases the efficiency. 

MEEA* incorporates the exploration capacity of MCTS into A* search.
