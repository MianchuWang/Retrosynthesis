## Background

Shi et al. (2020) proposed the semi-template-based method:

1. identify synthons, i.e., incomplete molecule,
2. complete synthons by sequential generation of *atoms or SMILES characters*.

## Contributions

GraphRetro completes the synthons by generation of *subgraphs*, i.e., leaving group.
