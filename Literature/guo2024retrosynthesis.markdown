## The Retrosynthesis Game

**State**: a molecule including products, intermediates, and buyable molecules.

**Action**: reaction rule/template.

**Policy**: it takes a state and produces a probability distribution over rules.

## Summary

ReSynZ trains the neural network policy using the extra data generated by MCTS.
The paper seems not to mention the way to update the NN policy, 
while Section 2.2.3 implies that the policy is trained by minimising the MSE/cross-entropy, 
as AlphaGo Zero and Reanalysis.
