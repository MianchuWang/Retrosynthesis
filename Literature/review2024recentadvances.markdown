## Molecule Representation

### 1. One-dimensional molecule representation

* **Fingerprints**: encodes physicochemical or structural properties but irreversible.

* **SMILES**: canonicalization algorithm ensures one-to-one mapping between SMILES and molecules.

### 2. Two-dimensional molecule representation

An adjacency matrix represents a graph, where atoms are represented by nodes and bonds by edges.

## One-step Retrosynthesis

### 1. Selection-based methods

* Reactant selection
* Template selection
* Semi-template selection
* Template-free selection
